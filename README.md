# Crypto Faucet Bot

## Overview

The **Crypto Faucet Bot** is a Python automation tool that helps users claim cryptocurrency from faucet websites by entering their wallet address and clicking the claim button. This bot is intended for personal use on faucet websites that do not restrict automation, and it requires manual captcha solving.

### Features

- **Automates Faucet Claims**: Automatically navigates to a faucet page, enters a wallet address, and clicks the claim button.
- **Captcha Prompt**: Allows for manual captcha solving if prompted by the website.
- **Logging**: Provides real-time logging of each step for easy monitoring.

### Prerequisites

To use this script, you’ll need:

1. Python 3.x
2. [Selenium WebDriver](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/)
3. ChromeDriver (or GeckoDriver if using Firefox)

You can install the Selenium library with:

```bash
pip install selenium
```

You’ll also need a Chrome or Firefox WebDriver installed and available in your system's PATH. Download [ChromeDriver](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads) or [GeckoDriver](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases) if necessary.

### Usage

#### Step 1: Update Faucet URL and Wallet Address

Replace `faucet_url` and `wallet_address` in the script with the actual faucet URL and your wallet address.

#### Step 2: Run the Script

Run the script using the following command:

```bash
py crypto_faucet_bot.py
```

The bot will:

1. Open the specified faucet page.
2. Enter your wallet address into the appropriate input field.
3. Click the "claim" button.
4. Pause to allow you to manually solve any captcha if prompted.
5. Close the browser after a successful claim attempt.

### Example

```bash
py crypto_faucet_bot.py
```

### Important Notes

- **Captcha**: This bot assumes manual captcha-solving. Automated captcha solutions are typically against faucet terms of service.
- **Terms of Service**: Always review and comply with the terms of each faucet website.
- **Frequency**: Some faucets restrict claim frequency; automate responsibly to avoid bans.

### Limitations

- **Captcha-Solving**: Manual captcha-solving is required.
- **Automation Restrictions**: Many faucet sites may have anti-bot measures; use at your own risk and follow site rules.

### Troubleshooting

- **Captcha Timeout**: Increase the `time.sleep()` duration if you need more time for manual captcha solving.
- **WebDriver Compatibility**: Ensure your WebDriver version matches your browser version.

### Future Improvements

- **Captcha Automation**: Integrate with third-party captcha solvers (note: these may have fees and compliance issues).
- **Multi-Faucet Support**: Allow the bot to rotate through a list of faucet sites.
- **Scheduled Claims**: Implement timed claims to comply with faucet restrictions.

This script serves as a basic bot for faucets that don’t heavily restrict automated claiming. If you need assistance with setup or have questions about customizing it for specific websites, let me know!print('fzcujlgf')
